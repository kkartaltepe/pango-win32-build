Requirements:
This terrifying build setup requires a few things,
1) CMake 3.0 for windows (Only tested with version 3.7)
2) Meson and Ninja for windows
3) Python2 (I think cygwin python is good enough)
4) A working cygwin environment with some normal unix tools (bash, wget, tar, git, patch, rsync)
5) pkg-config for windows or cygwin(tested and written for cygwin pkg-config, blame glib)
6) VS Build tools, or a full VS environment


Environment Setup:
1) Add Python, CMake, Meson, and Ninja to your PATH (windows), and pkg-config if not using cygwin pkg-config
2) Either hardwire cygwin envvars with those of the 'VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt',
	or launch a cygwin terminal from within such a prompt (ensure cygwin is set up to inherit
	windows environment variable, this is untested).
3) cd to the pango-win32-build directory
4) run prepare.sh
5) Assuming i did everything correctly, you are done and all the required pango artifacts are
	stored in ./install
6) As things break horrifically let me know so we can work through any potentional issues.
