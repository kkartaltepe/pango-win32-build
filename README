Requirements:
This terrifying build setup requires a few things,
1) CMake 3.0 for windows (Only tested with version 3.7)
2) Meson and Ninja for windows
3) A working cygwin environment with some normal unix tools (bash, wget, tar, git, patch)
4) pkg-config for windows or cygwin(tested and written for cygwin pkg-config, blame glib)
5) VS Build tools, or a full VS environment


Environment Setup:
1) Add CMake, Meson, and Ninja to your PATH (windows)
1) Either hardwire cygwin envvars with those of the 'VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt',
	or launch a cygwin terminal from within such a prompt (ensure cygwin is set up to inherit
	windows environment variable, this is untested).
2) cd to the pango-win32-build directory
3) run prepare.sh
4) Assuming i did everything correctly, you are done and all the required pango artifacts are
	stored in ./install
5) As things break horrifically let me know so we can work through any potentional issues.
